### CollegeWordPressTheme

<p>A demo website for educational institutions.  Provides a front end which allows users to browse college programs, review events, and even to register, create, edit and store their own notes.

<ul>
<li>Why code is the key to building whatever you can imagine with WordPress</li>
<li>The ability to write PHP to manipulate the data of a WordPress site</li>
<li>The ability to write JavaScript to add on-the-fly interactivity to a WordPress site</li>
<li>How to code your own new custom block types for the "Gutenberg" Block Editor</li>

<p>Credit to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/bradschiff/">Brad Schiff</a> for developing and presenting an excellent course which brings WordPress to life.</p>

<p>The material herein varies from the course material in several important ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>The navbars are kept as an adjustable theme feature editable through the admin panel.</li>
<li>The text, images and page content for the website pages and posts have been altered.</li>
<li>The code has been substantially refactored and reorganized.  There are no mandatory plugins and functions.php has been substantially reduced in size and nature</li>
<li>As is consistent with most WordPress themes today, the "single-{name}" and "page-{name}" type files have been abandoned in favor of conditional rendering inside single.php and page.php, respectively.</li>
</ol>
