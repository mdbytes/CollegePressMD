<h3>Course Covers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why code is the key to building whatever you can imagine with WordPress</li>
<li>The ability to write PHP to manipulate the data of a WordPress site</li>
<li>The ability to write JavaScript to add on-the-fly interactivity to a WordPress site</li>
<li>How to code your own new custom block types for the "Gutenberg" Block Editor</li>
<li>The skills, knowledge and vocabulary to work professionally as a WordPress developer</li>

<p>Credit to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/bradschiff/">Brad Schiff</a> for developing and presenting an excellent course which brings WordPress to life.</p>

<p>The material herein varies from the course material in several important ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>The navbars are kept as an adjustable theme feature editable through the admin panel.</li>
<li>The text, images and page content for the website pages and posts have been altered.</li>
<li>The code has been substantially refactored and reorganized.  There are no mandatory plugins and functions.php has been substantially reduced in size and nature</li>
<li>As is consistent with most WordPress themes today, the "single-{name}" and "page-{name}" type files have been abandoned in favor of conditional rendering inside single.php and page.php, respectively, with more extensive use of template parts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Plugins developed for this theme have been included within the assets/plugins subdirectories. These plugins include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A word count plugin which provides estimated word count and reading time for each post, placing the information at the beginning end of the post.</li>
<li>A word filter plugin which provides admin users the ability to filter words which are published.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
